# Installing SigPatches   

I know some users do need them to install homebrew nsps to their switches in their emunand.     
for example, I made hbmenu nsp and installed hbmenu to my home screen for easy access to full ram.      

There are two methods to install Sigpatches now.  


Method #1  
1. download 'sigpatch-updater.nro' from [https://github.com/ITotalJustice/sigpatch-updater/releases](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/sigpatch-updater/releases)   
2. make folder sigpatch-updater in switch folder on your sd card  
3. put 'sigpatch-updater.nro' in sigpatch-updater folder in switch folder   
4. make sure you select the top option for atmosphere users  
4. open it in your hbmenu. press A to install the sigpatches  
5. press + to exit the sigpatch-updater  
6. use reboot to payload to reboot atmosphere
