# Save Management

For save management,  [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV/releases) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. It also has the ability to edit saves for extra items etc. 
JKSV have support for saves from Animal Crossing New Horizons, Thats why I am recommending JKSV over any other save management apps now.   

[Checkpoint](https://github.com/flagbrew/checkpoint/releases) is also a save manager. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. It also has the ability to share save data over FTP and WiFi.
