# list of ban risks  

Ban Risk:

Instant ban:  
• Piracy of any sort  
• Homebrew nsps  
• Changing user icon through homebrew  
• Sketchy eShop behavior   

Not so instant ban, but still a ban:  
• Modding online games  
• Cheating in online games  
• Clearing error logs after they've been uploaded to Nintendo  

Not a ban, so far:  
• Homebrew  
• Custom themes  
• Mods/cheating in offline games  
• emummc  
(this assumes that you disable online syncing for games you intend to save edit of course)  

Thank you to Val (Free Hugs) at ReSwitched server for this list.  

       
# My own experiment  

I bought too many switches myself from ebay lol  
back in June 28th 2019, I bought Super Mario Maker 2 game cart.  
I put it in my atmosphere switch setup with emunand with 6.2 sysnand.  
I created new account and linked it on this switch right in atmosphere CFW.  
I kept updating it normal via Nintendo servers in emunand.  I also do game updates normally in atmosphere CFW.   
It gone thru 3 updates now.  I am still playing Super Mario Maker 2.  
I admit that I did injected my saves from my banned unit to this switch.   
I also using my own custom themes and fonts on this switch.  
only thing different is No Sigpatches and GoldLeaf on it.   
I only use game carts and my purchased eshop games.   

This shows that any kind of piracy will get your switch banned.
