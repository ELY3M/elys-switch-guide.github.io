# About this guide

I want to be clear that I did improved and modified the Nintendo Homebrew's guide and I am giving credit and thanks to those people listed here.    
I forked [this guide](https://switchgui.de) and modified it to make it more simpler, less steps, and have more extra guides for common things done on Switch CFW.   
I used my Nintendo Switch to modify this guide :)
